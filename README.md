##Advent of Code 2021
The purpose of this repository is to house my solutions for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com).
This challenge can be done in any language but I will primarily be using Python and R.
###Goals
The goal of participating is for me to practice using github on the command-line. The repitition of updating this repository daily (hopefully) will help build the muscle memory of git commands.
